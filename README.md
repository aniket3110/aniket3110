- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aniket3110
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in develepment web application in asp.net
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mvc. 


Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you will find a comprehensive collection of projects showcasing my experience in developing robust and efficient web applications using ASP.NET C# with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. These projects follow a Tree-Tier Architecture, allowing for modular and scalable development.



Technologies Used:

ASP.NET C#: The foundation of these projects lies in the powerful and versatile ASP.NET framework, utilizing C# for server-side logic and application development.
MVC Architecture: Each project adheres to the Model-View-Controller design pattern, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.
API Development: I have integrated RESTful APIs in various projects, enabling smooth communication between different components of the application and supporting seamless integration with external services.
SQL Database: To ensure data persistence and efficient data management, these projects are backed by a SQL database. I have designed and optimized the database schema to support the application's requirements.
Redis Cache: For high-performance caching, I have implemented Redis caching in select projects. This not only improves response times but also reduces the load on the database.
Solr: Some projects utilize Apache Solr for powerful and efficient full-text search functionality, enhancing the user experience by providing fast and relevant search results.



Project Highlights:

Project 1: E-Commerce Platform

Developed a feature-rich e-commerce website using ASP.NET MVC and C#.
Implemented a product catalog, shopping cart, and secure payment processing.
Utilized Redis cache to improve response times for frequently accessed data.
Integrated Solr for lightning-fast product searches, enabling users to find products quickly.
Project 2: Task Management System API

Created a RESTful API for a task management system, allowing users to create, update, and prioritize tasks.
Implemented a Tree-Tier Architecture, separating business logic, data access, and presentation layers.
Utilized SQL database for storing task-related data, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
Employed Redis cache to store frequently accessed task information, reducing database queries.
Project 3: Social Media Dashboard

Developed a social media dashboard that aggregates data from multiple platforms using their respective APIs.
Utilized ASP.NET Web API to handle data retrieval and processing from different social media platforms.
Implemented OAuth for secure authentication and authorization with the social media APIs.
Leveraged Redis cache to store user-specific data, providing a seamless user experience.
